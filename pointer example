#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;       
    int *ptr;        
    ptr = &a;         
    printf("Value of a: %d\n", a);
    printf("Address of a: %p\n", &a);
    printf("Value stored in pointer (address of a): %p\n", ptr);
    printf("Value pointed to by pointer: %d\n", *ptr);
    *ptr = 20;  
    printf("New value of a after pointer update: %d\n", a);

    return 0;
}
Output:

Copy code
Value of a: 10
Address of a: 0x7ffee83b9c9c
Value stored in pointer (address of a): 0x7ffee83b9c9c
Value pointed to by pointer: 10
New value of a after pointer update: 20
Would you like me to show a more advanced pointer program (e.g., arrays, functions, or dynamic memory)?
